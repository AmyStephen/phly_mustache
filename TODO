Pragma tokenizing
    Recognize pragmas and tokenize them
    Ideally, provide methodology for extending lexer and renderer via pragmas
Partial rendering
    Gateway should act as a facade for lexing and rendering
    Inject itself into renderer
    When a partial is found, render the partial using the current view
        Current renderer then appends the output
